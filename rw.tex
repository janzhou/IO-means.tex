\section{Related Work}

Since a computational model for neural networks was created in 1940s~\cite{McCulloch1943},
lots of research has been devoted into this approach~\cite{pouyanfar2018survey}.
Though it was theoretically proven to be a powerful model which was able to approximate any interest function to any degree of accuracy
Hornik et. al.~\cite{Hornik1989}, it did not exert its full strength until last decade due to the lack of enough data and computational resource.
As those issues has been recently addressed by collecting suitable datasets~\cite{JiaDeng2009}
and introducing specialized computing devices~\cite{Krizhevsky2012, Jouppi2017},
it has achieved breakthrough performance on a variety of research problems~\cite{Krizhevsky2012, Mnih2015, Silver2016, Bahdanau2014}.
